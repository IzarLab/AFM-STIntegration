# SPiFT: Stiffness Profiling Integrated with Functional Transcriptomics

SPiFT integrates **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)** with **Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)** and **single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)** to create a unified framework for mapping tissue stiffness and gene expression at near single-cell resolution. This novel approach enables researchers to explore the interplay between mechanical properties and transcriptional dynamics in complex tissue microenvironments, such as the tumor microenvironment (TME).
